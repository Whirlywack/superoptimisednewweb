- Section Headline: "Why Build in Public?"
- Paragraph 1: "Traditional development happens behind closed doors. Decisions are made in isolation, problems are hidden until launch, and communities only see the polished final product."
- Paragraph 2: "I'm building differently. Every decision gets documented, every challenge shared, and the community helps shape the direction. This transparency leads to better products, stronger relationships, and genuine learning."
- Highlighted Quote: "The best feedback comes from real problems, not survey responses. Building transparently creates trust‚Äîand trust creates honest input."
- Paragraph 3: "Most conversations happen on X (@superoptimised) where you can see live decision-making, vote in polls, and influence the building process. This website documents the complete journey for deeper context."
